  <p>Much of these ideas I got from my amazing coach, Patrick Barragan.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m about to trivialize 7 years of mental struggle and anguish in my life into a single idea, and basically a single word. This idea is that we all have unique control over our minds, and over the path that we choose to take in this world. That with training, determination, and belief we can reach the center of our own beings, and make a decision on our own, without external influence. That we have &ldquo;free will&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For pole vault, that we can turn on all the green lights and say the word &ldquo;yes&rdquo; whenever we want to. Whether or not we actually have the power to make these decisions is irrelevant. What matters is that we believe wholeheartedly in the decision we make. That when we say &ldquo;yes, I can pole vault and I can pole vault well whenever I want to, and whenever I want to is all the time, regardless of extraneous external sensory input that act to tell me otherwise&rdquo;, we truly believe that is the case. It&rsquo;s not something we come to in our rational mind that may be sidestepped by stronger parts of the brain like the places where fear and other emotions live. To actually make a decision, we need to let it envelop our entire being. To turn on all the green lights, and unplug all the red lights.</p>

<p>This is one of the hardest things to do in life, because it involves absolute control and belief in that control over our minds. That is where the complications arise, and why it took me 7 years to arrive at this point.</p>

<p>But once here, we realize that given enough time, we can do anything.</p>

  <p>My first real meet of the season ended in a no-height. However, this was unlike any no-heights committed before. It was almost like it needed to happen- like I subconsciously made it happen.</p>

<p>Everything that could have gone wrong externally did, short of a serious injury. I forgot the specific pole I needed to start with; I planted weird in warm ups and slipped off the pole while it was still bent in the air; I kept cutting my hand open and bleeding; a teammate knocked me on the head with a pole; I had to wait over an hour before I entered the competition, etc.</p>

<div class="entry-content clearfix">
  <p>Mu is an ancient Zen concept that means “unasking a question”. It is the third answer to a yes or no question. However, it’s also understood in a broader context, representing the point at which opposites intersect or the fundamental meaning behind paradoxes. It’s best understood through Zen koans— traditional Zen stories that attempt to reveal the underlying nature of the universe through odd, simple, nonsensical stories.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

  <p>Now I am removed from the intensity of MIT and pole vault. Flying to San Francisco and focusing on new things allows me to step back and review what I’ve written and where I am at right now. More than almost any other point in my life- I am content. Not entirely so, but enough so that I don’t need to constantly think of the things I am not doing. I am okay with going to work for a good portion of the day, and spending time commuting on a train, and then working out, eating dinner, and going to bed. There are definitely some things I want to do to better myself, but they mostly involve talking to girls. In fact I would be entirely content this summer if all I did was work, work out a lot, and talk to lots of girls.</p>

  <p>I spent some time moping after the disappointing no-height. Sure, it&rsquo;s easy to blame it on the lack of sleep, but I was pissed at myself for not (never) producing acceptable results, no matter how much I put in. I thought a lot about hidden states which produce physical outcomes. You can only work on the hidden states, but you usually only measure the physical outcomes. Clearly I&rsquo;ve developed the hidden states a lot this year,

  <p>Who fucking gives a shit</p>

<p>Kind of my anthem for the final meet before nationals. I didn&rsquo;t sleep the night before for whatever stupid reason. Ran thru 3 times for a circular ending to a long story. This season turned out the same as senior year of high school except that I&rsquo;m jumping 8 inches higher and I don&rsquo;t get as mad or sad and I&rsquo;m a little more confident in myself as a human being. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve actually changed and improved since then or if I just build these temporary paths around the permanent mental problem. There&rsquo;s no way to know for sure and I&rsquo;ve given my life to this sport so I have to assume i have changed and continue with my last two years and try to keep overcoming it.</p>

<p>The thing is that I&rsquo;m so mentally exhausted of this shit. I give up so much time and energy to solving this shit. I could do so much more with my life, be so much happier.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just tired from last night. But I have lots of new great habits to form over the summer and do great things. I&rsquo;ll worry about this shit in the fall.</p>

  <p>What I&rsquo;m thinking about (obviously related to pole vault)</p>

<p>Finding and preserving the right state is critically important. There is a particular state in which I can pole vault. And in this state pole vaulting is easy. In this state I&rsquo;m happy, loose, light-headed, carefree, laughing a lot, not thinking about what could go wrong, reducing the sport to a game. Having fun. Right now transitioning to and from this state is a volatile process. It&rsquo;s an unstable state. Too hard to get in, too easy to get out. I need to work on:</p>

  <p>When things get too intense or not intense enough, get rid of the pressure and tenseness through humor.</p>

<h1>Practice:</h1>

<p>Anything to make it fun, ridiculous, easy, and familiar will take the mind off of the grip and ease the transition back to good habits. Example: no shorts jumping!</p>

<h1>Meets:</h1>

<p>To encourage some level of competitiveness, but keep pressure, tenseness, paralysis, and importance down, think of some hilarious thing you&rsquo;re competing for. This will give you a drive to win that&rsquo;s rooted in something silly so that the muscles are relaxed and the good habits flow easily. Example: Get the snacks back!!! Or, they took our jobs! Or, they brought dishonor to the family!!</p>

  <p>Today I realized the final step which I hadn&rsquo;t talked about yesterday. To truly find success, you must have a sort of ultimate meta-belief about your beliefs&mdash; that you are in complete control of your beliefs, and thus your destiny. You need to know that you have total mind-control, and whenever a doubt or misbelief enters your head you have the capability to change it or remove it. This belief is really a feeling, one that permeates your whole body and allows you to let go, to be at peace. With this feeling comes absolute freedom. You are in control of the beliefs, which control your habits, which control your life.</p>

<div class="entry-content clearfix">
  <p>Today I put the finishing touches on the solution to the hardest problem I have ever faced. I&rsquo;ve known about this problem for the last four and a half years, and have been trying to solve it since day one. It&rsquo;s driven me far deeper into the sport of pole vaulting than I would have ever imagined I&rsquo;d be capable of. The sheer number of hours dedicated to understanding and overcoming the problem is far more than I believe most people ever dedicate to a single entity, and the variance and intensity of the emotions I&rsquo;ve experienced as a result of it over the last 5 years has taken me on a ridiculous roller coaster ride that seems so far removed from my otherwise average upbringing.</p>

  <p>(context: I had changed the way I practice the day before this, to erase
extraneous habits and meaning and just treat myself as a brand-new pole
vaulter)</p>

<h2>Vault day 2</h2>

<p>I practiced and got better today. I kept doing what coach told me to do and moved to 4 step ad then 4 step bending on the 14 165. I was able to keep my mind clear for a while, and take a bunch of really good vaults. Then it became too small so I needed to go up a pole. He told me to go to the 14&#8217; 6 165. I couldn&rsquo;t keep my mind clear enough and didn&rsquo;t take off the ground on that. But I kept my mind as clear as I could, went back down to the smaller pole, and almost took off, but I couldn&rsquo;t keep mind clear enough.</p>

  <p>Really pinpointed the problem. When I slipped off the pole the second time, it was for no conceivable reason, and so in processing the event my body searched for a reason it happened. It ultimately concluded that the answer lies in the tiny differences between how the poles feel in my hands. So tape jobs, pole width, how sticky/chalky/slippery my hands are. And so I&rsquo;m not comfortable switching poles that I haven&rsquo;t jumped on recently because they feel slightly differently and I associate that with the possibility of slipping off the pole. So I need to desensitize myself to these differences, and dissociate the strength of my grip and how it feels with whether I slip off the pole or not. It shouldn&rsquo;t matter whatsoever. Next step is to somehow practice disassociating this.</p>

  <p>Took a bunch of 3&rsquo;s on the 14&#8217; 155, which seemed slightly bigger than the 150 but still manageable. But I was trying to get my step out and stand up taller, which made things feel weird. Then things still felt weird when I tried to go back to 4. I then went to a small green pole but I had never jumped on it before so it took me a few to take one up. But I got on it and it was pretty small. Then I kept going back and forth between taking some decent jumps from 3 and trying to go from 4 on that pole. I got pretty close at the end when I really got into a rhythm and really pretended like it was just a 3 step, to the point when I would do a really quick pole grab and run the first two steps without thinking, and then count my 3 step out loud.</p>

<div class="entry-content clearfix">
  <p>Ran thru at the meet on Saturday, but did not get frustrated the whole time, and only felt a bit of pressure. After, I knew I was fundamentally okay, and changed from previous years. My mind is solid, my confidence is sold, and the only thing holding me back is that the fallback when I don&rsquo;t think is running through. In practice today, I started at bending from 3 on a small pole, started going up poles and then going to 4 and continuing to go up poles. I was perfect until moved from the 14 165 to the 14 170.

  <p>At first focused on how much I love pole vaulting. Took some really solid 3 steps. Went back to 5, was far outside on the first jump and ran through. Thought about running normally and fast for the next time and was more on but still ran thru. Might have taken a couple more run thrus before trying 3 steps again and then slide box. Slide box was weird though because I was like 2-3 ft outside. So I tried to reset completely, pretend like practice was just starting again, and try to sort of meditate and just concentrate on my breath, not allowing any pole vault related thoughts enter, besides the occasionally count down as I was about to take a jump. I felt tired and off by this point though. I did manage to keep my mind mostly off pole vault, even while on the runway, but it seemed like my default no-thoughts vault was a run through. I was able to get off the ground pretty successfully from 3. I also tried to push positive thoughts out of my head, like about how much I love pole vaulting and want to be here in the moment more than anything else, so that my mind was just blank. Even though it was blank, I think I was still scared/doubtful.</p>

  <p>My name is Ben Schreck, and this is my blog. I'm a junior at MIT studying
  electrical engineering and computer science, with plans to venture
  into the crazy land of music technology and change the way we interact
  with music. I also pole vault, and this blog chronicles how my life
  shapes and is shaped by my pole vault endeavours. I'll attempt to
  show you my adventures up till this point through odd ideas
  related to pole vaulting, meditation, zen buddhism, rap music, talking
  to girls, dealing with confidence, and contemplating life itself.
  Hopefully I'll leave you with a window into my mind.</p>
