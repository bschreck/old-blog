  <p>Now I am removed from the intensity of MIT and pole vault. Flying to San Francisco and focusing on new things allows me to step back and review what I’ve written and where I am at right now. More than almost any other point in my life- I am content. Not entirely so, but enough so that I don’t need to constantly think of the things I am not doing. I am okay with going to work for a good portion of the day, and spending time commuting on a train, and then working out, eating dinner, and going to bed. There are definitely some things I want to do to better myself, but they mostly involve talking to girls. In fact I would be entirely content this summer if all I did was work, work out a lot, and talk to lots of girls.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This is good because my mind is relaxed and not constantly struggling to visualize the perfect vault and the perfect state I need to be in to vault. That was a necessary, but off-the-mark consequence of searching deep inside my mind for answers and for tools to better myself. Inwardly, I made great strides this year, and it was almost enough to outwardly show. However, I ended the season with an exhausted mind- which is clearly not a healthy mind. Why was it exhausted? I spent tons of energy expelling negative thoughts, trying to get into the right state of mind, and developing good habits. While I was successful, I needed more time than I had to digest the thoughts and let them become a part of me so it wasn’t a chore to bring them out. The times when I found myself most “in the zone”, and able to pole vault, were when I was completely relaxed, happy, and confident. Unfortunately, it was difficult to fall into this state whenever I wanted to, and as a consequence I was still inconsistent towards the end. I needed more time. I know now what it feels like to take off, and I know that my mind knows it can do it, and how to do it, and so I will not have to wrestle with it every day. I will be able to just flow, and let my unconscious take care of the work. There are no more demons hidden deep within my mind that I need to be scared of. I have found all of them. I know what they look like, what they feed off of, and how to deal with them. I get a fresh start.</p>

<p>This summer, I will get healthy, get strong, get relaxed, get confident, get rested, and get ready. I don’t need to put a lot of energy into the mental game because I have already won it, and I both already have the habits needed to carry me forward, and the wherewithal to create all the habits I need. I will take a few weeks in the middle of the summer to do one last soul-searching and let the last few stragglers of another time out of the gates of my head, and then I will start performing.</p>

  <h1 class="title delta">About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Ben Schreck, and this is my blog. I'm a junior at MIT studying
  electrical engineering and computer science, with plans to venture
  into the crazy land of music technology and change the way we interact
  with music. I also pole vault, and this blog chronicles how my life
  shapes and is shaped by my pole vault endeavours. I'll attempt to
  show you my adventures up till this point through odd ideas
  related to pole vaulting, meditation, zen buddhism, rap music, talking
  to girls, dealing with confidence, and contemplating life itself.
  Hopefully I'll leave you with a window into my mind.</p>
