    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first real meet of the season ended in a no-height. However, this was unlike any no-heights committed before. It was almost like it needed to happen- like I subconsciously made it happen.</p>

<p>Everything that could have gone wrong externally did, short of a serious injury. I forgot the specific pole I needed to start with; I planted weird in warm ups and slipped off the pole while it was still bent in the air; I kept cutting my hand open and bleeding; a teammate knocked me on the head with a pole; I had to wait over an hour before I entered the competition, etc.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>However, none of this was able to penetrate my skull. I was mentally prepared to vault well throughout, without a single misstep. I was actually happy that all these things were happening because it would present me a challenging situation to practice my mental game, at a meet that didn&rsquo;t really matter. I was happy that I got to go up two poles, because I really wanted to get on the bigger one, even
though I wasn&rsquo;t ready for it. Plus, I didn&rsquo;t waste any jumps all meet. Every jump was an attempt, no matter how crappy it was.</p>

<p>It just turned out that the smaller pole was too small, and the bigger pole was too big. If I had come in 6&#8221; higher I probably would have made the height, but we couldn&rsquo;t see that at the time. When it was over after my third attempt, there was only mild frustration that lasted less than a minute. I knew I had done everything I could have done at the meet, and I could focus on the positives. Like the fact that I&rsquo;ll never forget a pole again, and that any slight tweaks to initi conditions would have let me win the meet.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m not afraid of any aspect of vaulting anymore. I&rsquo;ve proved to myself that I can jump what I&rsquo;ve known I theoretically could for years. And now it&rsquo;s time to start having some fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mu is an ancient Zen concept that means “unasking a question”. It is the third answer to a yes or no question. However, it’s also understood in a broader context, representing the point at which opposites intersect or the fundamental meaning behind paradoxes. It’s best understood through Zen koans— traditional Zen stories that attempt to reveal the underlying nature of the universe through odd, simple, nonsensical stories.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<!-- more -->


<blockquote><p>Joshu began the study of Zen when he was sixty years old and continued until he was eighty, when he realized Zen. He taught from the age of eighty until he was one hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>A student once asked him: &lsquo;If I haven’t anything in my mind, what shall I do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Joshu replied: &lsquo;Throw it out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But if I haven’t anything, how can I throw it out?&rsquo; continued the questioner.</p>

<p>‘Well,&lsquo; said Joshu, &#8216;then carry it out.’ “</p></blockquote>

<p>Reading this as a simple parable makes no sense, and that’s the point. It is supposed to stimulate thought about the vary nature of paradox. The next logical question you should have in your mind is, “What doers this mu nonsense have to do with pole vaulting?” Well that would also be hard to just explain logically. I’ll quote one more story here, and allow you to try to understand this question by gradually reading through and following my journey as I blog about it.</p>

<p>This is my favorite Zen quote, written by a Japanese Zen master in the middle of the 20th century:</p>

<blockquote><p>To realize Zen one has to pass through the barrier of the patriarchs. Enlightenment always comes after the road of thinking is blocked. If you do not pass the barrier of the patriarchs or if your thinking road is not blocked, whatever you think, whatever you do, is like a tangling ghost. You may ask: &lsquo;What is a barrier of a patriarch?’ This one word, ‘MU’, is it.</p>

<p>This is the barrier of Zen. If you pass through it, you will see Joshu face to face. Then you can work hand in hand with the whole line of patriarchs. Is this not a pleasant thing to do?</p>

<p>If you want to pass this barrier, you must work through every bone in your body, through every pore of your skin, filled with this question: ‘What is ‘MU’?’ and carry it day and night. Do not believe it is the common negative symbol meaning nothing. It is not nothingness, the opposite of existence. If you really want to pass this barrier you should feel like drinking a hot iron ball that you can neither swallow nor spit out.</p>

<p>Then your previous lesser knowledge disappears. As a fruit ripening in season, your subjectivity and objectivity naturally become one. It is like a dumb man who has had a dream. He knows about it but he cannot tell it.</p>

<p>When he enters this condition his ego-shell is crushed and he can shake the heaven and move the earth. He is like a great warrior with a sharp sword. If a Buddha stands in his way, he will cut him down; if a patriarch offer him any obstacle, he will kill him; and he will be free in his way of birth and death. He can enter any world as if it were his own playground. I will tell you how to do this with this koan:</p>

<p>Just concentrate your whole energy into this MU, and do not allow any discontinuation. When you enter this MU and there is no discontinuation, your attainment will be as a candle burning and illuminating the whole universe.</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://bschreck.github.io/blog/2013/05/30/taking-a-step-back-for-summer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now I am removed from the intensity of MIT and pole vault. Flying to San Francisco and focusing on new things allows me to step back and review what I’ve written and where I am at right now. More than almost any other point in my life- I am content. Not entirely so, but enough so that I don’t need to constantly think of the things I am not doing. I am okay with going to work for a good portion of the day, and spending time commuting on a train, and then working out, eating dinner, and going to bed. There are definitely some things I want to do to better myself, but they mostly involve talking to girls. In fact I would be entirely content this summer if all I did was work, work out a lot, and talk to lots of girls.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This is good because my mind is relaxed and not constantly struggling to visualize the perfect vault and the perfect state I need to be in to vault. That was a necessary, but off-the-mark consequence of searching deep inside my mind for answers and for tools to better myself. Inwardly, I made great strides this year, and it was almost enough to outwardly show. However, I ended the season with an exhausted mind- which is clearly not a healthy mind. Why was it exhausted? I spent tons of energy expelling negative thoughts, trying to get into the right state of mind, and developing good habits. While I was successful, I needed more time than I had to digest the thoughts and let them become a part of me so it wasn’t a chore to bring them out. The times when I found myself most “in the zone”, and able to pole vault, were when I was completely relaxed, happy, and confident. Unfortunately, it was difficult to fall into this state whenever I wanted to, and as a consequence I was still inconsistent towards the end. I needed more time. I know now what it feels like to take off, and I know that my mind knows it can do it, and how to do it, and so I will not have to wrestle with it every day. I will be able to just flow, and let my unconscious take care of the work. There are no more demons hidden deep within my mind that I need to be scared of. I have found all of them. I know what they look like, what they feed off of, and how to deal with them. I get a fresh start.</p>

<p>This summer, I will get healthy, get strong, get relaxed, get confident, get rested, and get ready. I don’t need to put a lot of energy into the mental game because I have already won it, and I both already have the habits needed to carry me forward, and the wherewithal to create all the habits I need. I will take a few weeks in the middle of the summer to do one last soul-searching and let the last few stragglers of another time out of the gates of my head, and then I will start performing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Results don&rsquo;t show it</p>

<p>But I know I gave it all this season.</p>

<p>Why else would I get sad when I realize I have to do it all over again?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I think about all the shit that needs to happen from now till the time when I can express outwardly what I will have been preparing for and I just want to be at the end state for a while.
It&rsquo;s hard to imagine going through everything again.</p>

<p>This was a good season. Every day I came out with a purpose. Everyday I knew exactly what had to be done, and I did it.</p>

<p>And I did it right. I didn&rsquo;t do it for the outward success like I had previously. I did it for the inner transformation. In the end, that transformation didn&rsquo;t quite present itself outwardly like I would have liked, and like the other athletes around me were able to do. But it readied me for battle. It prepared me for life, and specifically for directing my life. What happens next is determined by me and me alone, with everyone else acting to help me out and let me live.</p>

<p>I won. I won at the only game that matters- the only game where winning means nothing. The only game where winning is never actually possible. I understand now. I can do whatever the flows around me hint is the downstream path. The disguised path of least resistance. This is not about swimming upstream, as most mental advisors, success advocates, and determined coaches will let me know. It&rsquo;s not about fighting &ldquo;the easy way&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s about discovering another, separate, much less violent or choppy path, through which I can flow silently with ease, content with every second of the ride.</p>

    <id>http://bschreck.github.io/blog/2013/05/18/hidden-states</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent some time moping after the disappointing no-height. Sure, it&rsquo;s easy to blame it on the lack of sleep, but I was pissed at myself for not (never) producing acceptable results, no matter how much I put in. I thought a lot about hidden states which produce physical outcomes. You can only work on the hidden states, but you usually only measure the physical outcomes. Clearly I&rsquo;ve developed the hidden states a lot this year, <!-- more -->even though the outcomes have been sub-par. I thought about how pissed off I was about how much energy I had put into this sport to not accomplish my goals- to end the season full circle with a final height of zero. I thought dangerous thoughts that maybe I didn&rsquo;t actual change anything this whole year, since results-wise it seemed to mimic my senior year of high school. Maybe all that time and energy were for naught. But the whole time I&rsquo;m laughing. And then I come home and talk and laugh with my friends, and forget about pole vault. And walk down to my room see all the anger, confusion, and sadness melt away and transform into confidence and clear intentions. Obviously this was not the end of Ben Schreck, pole vaulter. I have at least two more years. This was the mental year. The year shit was uncovered, untied, exposed, understood, dealt with, and used. I have learned more about myself and the world this year than any other year of my life by far. I have a completely different demeanor now than the beginning of the year. My confidence no longer rests on comparisons to others and compliments I receive. My emotions no longer sway to the rhythms of my surroundings- I am never held hostage by a misguided emotion. I direct my life now. Though I occasionally misstep, such as at today&rsquo;s meet, I do not believe those missteps become a part of me; I do not factor those missteps into how I carry myself in the world. They are all mistakes to be learned from, puzzled to be solved whose solutions come with keys to hidden compartments of my mind.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Who fucking gives a shit</p>

<p>Kind of my anthem for the final meet before nationals. I didn&rsquo;t sleep the night before for whatever stupid reason. Ran thru 3 times for a circular ending to a long story. This season turned out the same as senior year of high school except that I&rsquo;m jumping 8 inches higher and I don&rsquo;t get as mad or sad and I&rsquo;m a little more confident in myself as a human being. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve actually changed and improved since then or if I just build these temporary paths around the permanent mental problem. There&rsquo;s no way to know for sure and I&rsquo;ve given my life to this sport so I have to assume i have changed and continue with my last two years and try to keep overcoming it.</p>

<p>The thing is that I&rsquo;m so mentally exhausted of this shit. I give up so much time and energy to solving this shit. I could do so much more with my life, be so much happier.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just tired from last night. But I have lots of new great habits to form over the summer and do great things. I&rsquo;ll worry about this shit in the fall.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What I&rsquo;m thinking about (obviously related to pole vault)</p>

<p>Finding and preserving the right state is critically important. There is a particular state in which I can pole vault. And in this state pole vaulting is easy. In this state I&rsquo;m happy, loose, light-headed, carefree, laughing a lot, not thinking about what could go wrong, reducing the sport to a game. Having fun. Right now transitioning to and from this state is a volatile process. It&rsquo;s an unstable state. Too hard to get in, too easy to get out. I need to work on:</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>1) Recognizing the state I&rsquo;m in
2) Learning/practicing how to get into, get out of, and stay inside particular states
3) Making the pole vault state a super stable state- sort of a fallback, or natural state.</p>

<p>Laughing
Thinking about D3&rsquo;s
Thinking about “no shorts jumping”
Thinking about “getting the snacks”
Thinking about the takeoff feeling
Remember how easily 15’ 175 bent at All New Englands</p>

To truly find success, you must have a sort of ultimate meta-belief about your beliefs&mdash; that you are in complete control of your beliefs, and thus your destiny. You need to know that you have total mind-control, and whenever a doubt or misbelief enters your head you have the capability to change it or remove it. This belief is really a feeling, one that permeates your whole body and allows you to let go, to be at peace. With this feeling comes absolute freedom. You are in control of the beliefs, which control your habits, which control your life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I put the finishing touches on the solution to the hardest problem I have ever faced. I&rsquo;ve known about this problem for the last four and a half years, and have been trying to solve it since day one. It&rsquo;s driven me far deeper into the sport of pole vaulting than I would have ever imagined I&rsquo;d be capable of. The sheer number of hours dedicated to understanding and overcoming the problem is far more than I believe most people ever dedicate to a single entity, and the variance and [word for deepness] of the emotions I&rsquo;ve experienced as a result of it over the last 5 years has taken me on a ridiculous roller coaster ride that seems so far removed from my otherwise average upbringing.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In 10th grade, I had a rare, but certainly not wholly unexpected, sunscreen-related pole vault accident. I had applied sunscreen before practice, but had forgotten to wash my hands. When I tried to jump and take off the ground holding the pole, I couldn&rsquo;t maintain my grip and so I slipped off. The fiber glass pole was already bent from the pressure I had exerted with my arms, and so it rebounded against my knee. I was hurt pretty bad for an hour or so. But as a young, fearless pole vaulter with no history of accidents, I was able to get back on the runway later that day and easily take a few more jumps. It was a scary accident, but this was a scary sport and more than anything else it served to demonstrate that one of the most frightening incidents was not all that dangerous.</p>

<p>But my mind never really processed it to completion. An idea was implanted deep into the more primitive aspects of my mind that this sport was dangerous. I unconsciously attributed two reasons why this event occurred, in order to keep myself safe in the future. The obvious and correct one, that sunscreen compromised my grip in a freak accident, became the weaker of the two. The stronger one would come to haunt me for years. I came to believe that my grip strength was not sufficient, or was only barely sufficient, and that minuscule changes in the tape job, or the weather conditions, or how sticky my hands were that day directly affected my ability to hold on to the pole. So I stopped taking off the ground. I simply could not do it. I was a paralyzed pole vaulter who could not pole vault.</p>

<p>I began to refer to this inability to take off as the &ldquo;problem&rdquo;, or simply as &ldquo;it&rdquo;. &ldquo;It&rdquo; became the most frustrating part of my life for almost 5 years. In other writings, I have described in detail the various stories, triumphs, breakthroughs, losses, and expenses that occurred because of it, and so here I will only focus on the ultimate solution.</p>

<p>By the end of my freshman year of college, my coach helped me realize that in order to fix my problem, I would have to dig deep into my mind. It would be a journey. In fact, I would come to recognize that the whole time it had been a journey, albeit mostly an unconscious one prior to this point. Instead of trying to find out what was wrong with, or just demanding to myself that I needed to &ldquo;man up&rdquo;, I would have to confront the root cause of the problem, fully understand it, and gradually diminish its effects. I began to read all kinds of books on Eastern philosophy and began practicing meditation. I started to understand that in order to fix the problem, I would need to control my head. So I stopped getting frustrated when things didn&rsquo;t go according to plan. This was an extremely difficult task in and of itself, and after a year I have still have my occasional bouts of frustration, mostly pertaining to school and stress. But I&rsquo;m much, much better than I used to be, and I no longer succumb to anger or frustration during practice. I&rsquo;m able to sense my mental state changing for the worse before it holds me hostage, and can quickly reset to avoid trouble. This mind-control seemed like the solution for about 6 months- throughout the summer and into the fall of my sophomore year. I didn&rsquo;t have the problem once. However, &ldquo;it&rdquo; had never really began it&rsquo;s hold on me until January, and so just like every other year, it came back right when I arrived at MIT after winter break. It started with a little glitch. I went back to a 5-step from a 4 (pole-vaulter lingo- 4-step means 4 lefts away from the pit, or 8 steps. 5-step means 5 lefts or 10 steps), and felt slightly off. I became exceedingly conscious of my run, and could no longer take off. And this glitch persisted, and gradually developed into the full blown &ldquo;problem&rdquo;.</p>

<p>However, this time around I had the machinery to deal with it. I was extremely annoyed and confused at first, because I thought I had gotten rid of it for good. But then I accepted that it had come back and I would have to deal with it. I no longer got frustrated at practice. I kept my cool and began trying everything I had tried in the past to combat it. After about a month without much luck, I realized that my old techniques were not working, and didn&rsquo;t represent the full solution I was working towards. One day, I was fed up, depressed, and almost broke my nearly perfect composure at practice. I realized that this problem can&rsquo;t be unique to me, or even to my sport. So I switched to the other side of my brain, took out my laptop, and consulted the world&rsquo;s most trusted resource. I had researched this problem before; I had read 5 or 6 sports psychology books, and even consulted 3 different psychologists the summer before college who I didn&rsquo;t fully trust or really give enough time to see any benefit (I was also ashamed of using my parents money for what I perceived as a stupid problem). This time though, I was determined to find an underlying reason, and knew that it existed. Somehow I stumbled across a new school of sports psychology that claimed to solve this exact problem for many different athletes at all levels of play. They claimed that standard coaching methods simply do not work for these RSPP&rsquo;s (repetitive sports performance problems) because in reality they are a form of post-traumatic stress syndrome, and must be treated as such. I began to dig around more and more, experimenting with some ad-hoc techniques I found on youtube that claimed to treat PTSD, and then eventually bought a book. I think I read it in 2 days, which is no easy task on an MIT student&rsquo;s schedule.</p>

<p>The basic theory is that past trauma is not fully processed, and
triggers a flight/fight/freeze response unconsciously when stimulated by
putting oneself in a similar environment. I realize that every time I
pole vaulted, or even though about pole vaulting, a feeling of anxiety
would overwhelm me and cloud my thoughts. I still had not come to grips
with my high school incidents where I slipped off the pole. In order to
deal with this, I needed to allow my brain to process the events, and
realize that they were nothing to be concerned with. The psychologists
who had written the book had come up with a technique they call
&ldquo;brain-spotting&rdquo;, which consisted of fixating the eye on a particular
spot in the patient&rsquo;s field of vision that would trigger the stressful
reaction. Once this spot was found, the patient would relax and let
their mind/sub-conscious process the event. This is a form of EMDR
(Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), the technique used for
treating PTSD. I found a way to practice this on my own, and began noticing a difference in the way I visualized and thought about pole vault. I also consulted a psychologist who specialized in this treatment, but only a single time since I believed I could do it on my own, and I didn&rsquo;t want to pay for it.</p>

<p>While I began to believe that the brain-spotting would solve the issue of unprocessed trauma, it soon became clear that this was not the complete solution. I would fall back into my old habits easily, and the problem would come and go seemingly randomly. I began to experiment more and more with different techniques, including many new ones I made up myself, and for another month I accrued more and more thoughts, techniques, feelings, and emotions in my head during practice until finally one day my coach confronted me. He asked me a question that he asks me a lot: &ldquo;What are you thinking?&rdquo; I told him that there was a sea of negative thoughts floating around in my mind and I was desperately struggling to stay afloat. He thought for a minute, and told me to walk away, clear everything out of my head, and then come back. At that moment, we seemed to share a spark of insight.</p>

<p>I walked about 30 feet away, sat down, and meditated for 10-15 minutes.
When I came back, Patrick, my coach, began to instruct in the proper way
to pole vault:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben, today we are going to learn how to pole vault. This
is going to be a difficult endeavor, but if you follow everything I say
you will be both safe and successful. I want you to grab this pole, hold
here, take 3 big steps back from the box, take note of that mark, step
back from the runway and visualize yourself running 3 steps and then
jumping off the ground with the pole. Then proceed to the mark that your
remembered, and do exactly what you visualized in your head. Then come
see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did this, and in my mind I was just learning how to pole vault again.
I was a novice, with no habits, and I simply followed what my coach told
me to do in a purely mechanical way. Obviously this wasn&rsquo;t entirely
accurate- I still knew how to pole vault, and the whole act required
my body to remember the habits involved in knowing which muscles to use
when. However, in my head it made perfect sense that I was new to this.
I needed to relearn everything. And it started working. I took that jump
no problem, then walked over to Patrick to receive my next instruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good job, Ben. Now, I want you to listen to what I tell you. Today we
are going to learn how to pole vault. This is going to be a difficult
endeavor, but if you follow everything I say&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he repeated the same thing he had said before, and I repeated the
same thing I did before. This went on for a few more jumps, and he
gradually told me to do more and more things related to actually pole
vaulting. We continued this style of coaching for a couple weeks, until
I started internalizing it, and learning how to focus, and how to trust
my coach and myself.</p>

<p>Even though this new beginning worked incredibly well from my 3 step, when I went back to 4 the problem came back. However, it was incredibly clear now. My head was utterly empty up to the point when I stepped on the runway and grabbed the pole. Suddenly the problem revealed itself. I could turn it off and on. I could finally examine it in its full glory. I began the process of debugging my mind. First I simply observed it, and tried to get a handle on exactly when and why it showed itself. I determined that the root of the problem still lay with my grip in my right hand. Since I was able to take off on a small pole, I started off on that, and began to experiment with my grip. I changed the tape job after every job, and demonstrated to myself that nothing about my grip actually mattered. I literally peeled old, disgusting tape off of other poles and put it around the place where I held the pole, and still took off easily. I worked my way up to reasonably sized poles. This seemed like the end of it. But occasionally it crept back. I had one amazing meet, vaulting from my 3-step, which is so short that it is not even considered a true approach. Then the next meet I tried vaulting from 4, and failed miserably. I thought about why I had failed to jump, realized it was probably the stress of the meet, and spent the next two days making myself believe that pole vaulting was easy, and that I would have an amazing practice where I would take off the ground no problem. And it happened. And I started believing it more and more. I remembered how easy pole vaulting was.</p>

<p>Starting a few weeks before this I had begun reading a book called &ldquo;The Power of Habit&rdquo;. As the trauma aspect of my problem faded more and more into the distance, I began to realize that this trauma was really only half of the problem. And the reason it was so persistent even when the trauma was so removed from my mind lay in another fundamental aspect of human nature: habits. I had a habit of running through, an addiction. And I realized I was using the same cues to trigger both the nasty &ldquo;problem&rdquo; habit as well as the habit I wanted: actually pole vaulting. I started to notice these habits all the time, even when I wasn&rsquo;t vaulting. I could conjure them up in mental visualizations. They revolved around the same event, yet were distinct. One ended up with me either not being able to hold the pole, or not being strong enough to power the pole into the pit. In the other, I was much larger than the pole, easily bent it, and took a fantastic vault. I worked to make the good habit stronger than the bad, since I knew I couldn&rsquo;t permanently get rid of it.</p>

<p>This began to work. I started to believe I was a great pole vaulter again, and then I started doing something I had never done. I started to trivialize the sport. I started to believe it was easy. And I started vaulting really well. The thursday after that last meet where I tried to vault from 4 but no-heighted, I went back to a 5-step, and got on a fairly large pole. At the end I took a jump at a 14 foot bar, and easily skied it by a foot and a half. 14 had been fairly easy for me since my senior year of high school, but I could probably count on my right hand the times I had cleared anything higher. After that day the belief that I was really good at the sport finally seemed outwardly tangible. It had always been there, but I had always believed I was jumping far lower than my capabilities, and had been trying to prove myself for years. Now my mental abilities were finally catching up to my physical abilities, and I grew more and more confident. The next practice I cleared 15&#8217;3&#8221; easily, and the one after that I went back to my 6 step and got on even bigger poles. I started clearing 16 ft bungies. However, there were still a couple hiccups that I was determined to iron out. At the championship meet the following weekend, I only jumped 14 ft because I &ldquo;bailed out&rdquo; on too many jumps, meaning I took off, but didn&rsquo;t commit to a full pole vault. On my last attempt at 14&#8217;6&#8221;, I hesitated and stopped the jump early and just barely knocked the bar off, even though my hips were a foot and a half over it.</p>

<p>I became so excited to pole vault I could not concentrate on my school work. At practice on Monday, I started on the biggest pole I&rsquo;ve ever been on, but after a few jumps I started running through again. I went through my usual routine to refocus myself and start vaulting again, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to work this time. And then I realized why it wasn&rsquo;t working. I was using the same cues that led to my run-through habit. At this point, I decided that coming up with new cues would take a lot of work, and it was championship season, so I would put it off to next year. I instead decided to refocus and think about how easy it was to pole vault the last couple of weeks. I got back on the runway, laughed, thought about the triviality of it all, cleared my mind, visualized the jump, then stepped forward and took an amazing vault. When I walked off the pit I had one of those rare &ldquo;Eureka&rdquo; moments. I realized that the reason I had been vaulting so well was precisely because I had invented a new routine. I had come up with new cues, which triggered the good habit and let me vault well. I realized that, almost without fail, all the times I had taken off the ground had started with this new routine. It was as if my body and mind had unconsciously solved my problem for me. All I had to do now was clear my mind, believe whole-heartedly that pole-vaulting was easy, laugh a little, visualize, clear my head, step back on the runway behind my step, and then slowly walk up to my mark. Previously, my routine had consisted of me stepping onto the runway from the side, and not laughing or smiling. This new routine was different enough to launch myself into the new habit.</p>

<p>The old habit is still there, as well as a few other small tweaks that will occasionally prevent me from taking off. These include &ldquo;choking&rdquo;, where I become conscious of my run or my grip during the approach and break away from the good habit. However, I am 1000% confident in my ability to pole vault well, and the deep understanding of and familiarity with my mind I now have is already helping me succeed in all other areas of my life. My confidence is on a steadily upward slope, and coming out of this I feel like I can solve any problem given enough time. The whole process is the single most defining aspect of my mental growth and maturity over the past 5 years, even more so than MIT or my first long-term girlfriend. And although I believe I have completely characterized the problem, I also know that old habits never die, so I will need to constantly be on my toes to prevent them from exerting any influence on my life. The mental toolkit I have built to solve this problem will also stay with me for the rest of my life, and I know I will never succumb to habits, trauma, depression, or any tough situation. I plan on vaulting at least throughout college, and have set my goals high. Never mind if I actually accomplish all of them, because I have already accomplished the biggest one, and I love the process just as much as the end result. That being said, I do love winning, and nationals is right around the corner.</p>

extraneous habits and meaning and just treat myself as a brand-new pole
vaulter)</p>

<h2>Vault day 2</h2>

<p>I practiced and got better today. I kept doing what coach told me to do and moved to 4 step ad then 4 step bending on the 14 165. I was able to keep my mind clear for a while, and take a bunch of really good vaults. Then it became too small so I needed to go up a pole. He told me to go to the 14&#8217; 6 165. I couldn&rsquo;t keep my mind clear enough and didn&rsquo;t take off the ground on that. But I kept my mind as clear as I could, went back down to the smaller pole, and almost took off, but I couldn&rsquo;t keep mind clear enough.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Really pinpointed the problem. When I slipped off the pole the second time, it was for no conceivable reason, and so in processing the event my body searched for a reason it happened. It ultimately concluded that the answer lies in the tiny differences between how the poles feel in my hands. So tape jobs, pole width, how sticky/chalky/slippery my hands are. And so I&rsquo;m not comfortable switching poles that I haven&rsquo;t jumped on recently because they feel slightly differently and I associate that with the possibility of slipping off the pole. So I need to desensitize myself to these differences, and dissociate the strength of my grip and how it feels with whether I slip off the pole or not. It shouldn&rsquo;t matter whatsoever. Next step is to somehow practice disassociating this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Took a bunch of 3&rsquo;s on the 14&#8217; 155, which seemed slightly bigger than the 150 but still manageable. But I was trying to get my step out and stand up taller, which made things feel weird. Then things still felt weird when I tried to go back to 4. I then went to a small green pole but I had never jumped on it before so it took me a few to take one up. But I got on it and it was pretty small. Then I kept going back and forth between taking some decent jumps from 3 and trying to go from 4 on that pole. I got pretty close at the end when I really got into a rhythm and really pretended like it was just a 3 step, to the point when I would do a really quick pole grab and run the first two steps without thinking, and then count my 3 step out loud.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ran thru at the meet on Saturday, but did not get frustrated the whole time, and only felt a bit of pressure. After, I knew I was fundamentally okay, and changed from previous years. My mind is solid, my confidence is sold, and the only thing holding me back is that the fallback when I don&rsquo;t think is running through. In practice today, I started at bending from 3 on a small pole, started going up poles and then going to 4 and continuing to go up poles. I was perfect until moved from the 14 165 to the 14 170. <!-- more --> Because it felt bigger, and carried &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; as a real pole that I use that&rsquo;s &ldquo;big&rdquo; (even though I blow through on my first jump every time), something went off in my mind that said &ldquo;risky&rdquo; without me even articulating any thoughts. I couldn&rsquo;t take off with it. I went back down to the other pole and was completely fine. I kept swapping between the two but there was like this wall of risk in my mind preventing me from jumping on the bigger one. Eventually I tried another approach and went back to 5 steps with the smaller pole. I took two run throughs again here and hit the wall again. It seemed like maybe a slightly lower, softer wall though. Rewiring my brain to know that these two things are not actually risky is what I need to accomplish. And I need to do it not just for the 14 170 and a 5 step run, but for any bigger pole and any longer run. I think the way I will do that is by tearing down the wall brick by brick, slowly realizing (with my full mental concentration of what exactly I am doing) that the behavior is not actually risky. I plan to start with steps, because the wall seems lower (I never had a physical issue with steps- it is just a byproduct of other issues, whereas the bigger pole issue stems from a less than solid view of my grip, which originally came from the 3 times I let go of the pole).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At first focused on how much I love pole vaulting. Took some really solid 3 steps. Went back to 5, was far outside on the first jump and ran through. Thought about running normally and fast for the next time and was more on but still ran thru. Might have taken a couple more run thrus before trying 3 steps again and then slide box. Slide box was weird though because I was like 2-3 ft outside. So I tried to reset completely, pretend like practice was just starting again, and try to sort of meditate and just concentrate on my breath, not allowing any pole vault related thoughts enter, besides the occasionally count down as I was about to take a jump. I felt tired and off by this point though. I did manage to keep my mind mostly off pole vault, even while on the runway, but it seemed like my default no-thoughts vault was a run through. I was able to get off the ground pretty successfully from 3. I also tried to push positive thoughts out of my head, like about how much I love pole vaulting and want to be here in the moment more than anything else, so that my mind was just blank. Even though it was blank, I think I was still scared/doubtful.</p>
