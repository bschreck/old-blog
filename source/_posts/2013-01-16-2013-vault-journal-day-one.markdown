At first focused on how much I love pole vaulting. Took some really solid 3 steps. Went back to 5, was far outside on the first jump and ran through. Thought about running normally and fast for the next time and was more on but still ran thru. Might have taken a couple more run thrus before trying 3 steps again and then slide box. Slide box was weird though because I was like 2-3 ft outside. So I tried to reset completely, pretend like practice was just starting again, and try to sort of meditate and just concentrate on my breath, not allowing any pole vault related thoughts enter, besides the occasionally count down as I was about to take a jump. I felt tired and off by this point though. I did manage to keep my mind mostly off pole vault, even while on the runway, but it seemed like my default no-thoughts vault was a run through. I was able to get off the ground pretty successfully from 3. I also tried to push positive thoughts out of my head, like about how much I love pole vaulting and want to be here in the moment more than anything else, so that my mind was just blank. Even though it was blank, I think I was still scared/doubtful.
