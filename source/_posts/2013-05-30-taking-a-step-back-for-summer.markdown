Now I am removed from the intensity of MIT and pole vault. Flying to San Francisco and focusing on new things allows me to step back and review what I’ve written and where I am at right now. More than almost any other point in my life- I am content. Not entirely so, but enough so that I don’t need to constantly think of the things I am not doing. I am okay with going to work for a good portion of the day, and spending time commuting on a train, and then working out, eating dinner, and going to bed. There are definitely some things I want to do to better myself, but they mostly involve talking to girls. In fact I would be entirely content this summer if all I did was work, work out a lot, and talk to lots of girls.

This is good because my mind is relaxed and not constantly struggling to visualize the perfect vault and the perfect state I need to be in to vault. That was a necessary, but off-the-mark consequence of searching deep inside my mind for answers and for tools to better myself. Inwardly, I made great strides this year, and it was almost enough to outwardly show. However, I ended the season with an exhausted mind- which is clearly not a healthy mind. Why was it exhausted? I spent tons of energy expelling negative thoughts, trying to get into the right state of mind, and developing good habits. While I was successful, I needed more time than I had to digest the thoughts and let them become a part of me so it wasn’t a chore to bring them out. The times when I found myself most “in the zone”, and able to pole vault, were when I was completely relaxed, happy, and confident. Unfortunately, it was difficult to fall into this state whenever I wanted to, and as a consequence I was still inconsistent towards the end. I needed more time. I know now what it feels like to take off, and I know that my mind knows it can do it, and how to do it, and so I will not have to wrestle with it every day. I will be able to just flow, and let my unconscious take care of the work. There are no more demons hidden deep within my mind that I need to be scared of. I have found all of them. I know what they look like, what they feed off of, and how to deal with them. I get a fresh start.

This summer, I will get healthy, get strong, get relaxed, get confident, get rested, and get ready. I don’t need to put a lot of energy into the mental game because I have already won it, and I both already have the habits needed to carry me forward, and the wherewithal to create all the habits I need. I will take a few weeks in the middle of the summer to do one last soul-searching and let the last few stragglers of another time out of the gates of my head, and then I will start performing.
