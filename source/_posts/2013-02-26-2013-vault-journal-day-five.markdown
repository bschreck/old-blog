(context: I had changed the way I practice the day before this, to erase
extraneous habits and meaning and just treat myself as a brand-new pole
vaulter)

##Vault day 2

I practiced and got better today. I kept doing what coach told me to do and moved to 4 step ad then 4 step bending on the 14 165. I was able to keep my mind clear for a while, and take a bunch of really good vaults. Then it became too small so I needed to go up a pole. He told me to go to the 14' 6 165. I couldn't keep my mind clear enough and didn't take off the ground on that. But I kept my mind as clear as I could, went back down to the smaller pole, and almost took off, but I couldn't keep mind clear enough.
