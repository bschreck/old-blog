My first real meet of the season ended in a no-height. However, this was unlike any no-heights committed before. It was almost like it needed to happen- like I subconsciously made it happen.

Everything that could have gone wrong externally did, short of a serious injury. I forgot the specific pole I needed to start with; I planted weird in warm ups and slipped off the pole while it was still bent in the air; I kept cutting my hand open and bleeding; a teammate knocked me on the head with a pole; I had to wait over an hour before I entered the competition, etc.

However, none of this was able to penetrate my skull. I was mentally prepared to vault well throughout, without a single misstep. I was actually happy that all these things were happening because it would present me a challenging situation to practice my mental game, at a meet that didn't really matter. I was happy that I got to go up two poles, because I really wanted to get on the bigger one, even
though I wasn't ready for it. Plus, I didn't waste any jumps all meet. Every jump was an attempt, no matter how crappy it was.

It just turned out that the smaller pole was too small, and the bigger pole was too big. If I had come in 6" higher I probably would have made the height, but we couldn't see that at the time. When it was over after my third attempt, there was only mild frustration that lasted less than a minute. I knew I had done everything I could have done at the meet, and I could focus on the positives. Like the fact that I'll never forget a pole again, and that any slight tweaks to initi conditions would have let me win the meet.

So I'm not afraid of any aspect of vaulting anymore. I've proved to myself that I can jump what I've known I theoretically could for years. And now it's time to start having some fun.
