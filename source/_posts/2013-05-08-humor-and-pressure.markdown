When things get too intense or not intense enough, get rid of the pressure and tenseness through humor.

#Practice:

Anything to make it fun, ridiculous, easy, and familiar will take the mind off of the grip and ease the transition back to good habits. Example: no shorts jumping!

#Meets:

To encourage some level of competitiveness, but keep pressure, tenseness, paralysis, and importance down, think of some hilarious thing you're competing for. This will give you a drive to win that's rooted in something silly so that the muscles are relaxed and the good habits flow easily. Example: Get the snacks back!!! Or, they took our jobs! Or, they brought dishonor to the family!!
