Really pinpointed the problem. When I slipped off the pole the second time, it was for no conceivable reason, and so in processing the event my body searched for a reason it happened. It ultimately concluded that the answer lies in the tiny differences between how the poles feel in my hands. So tape jobs, pole width, how sticky/chalky/slippery my hands are. And so I'm not comfortable switching poles that I haven't jumped on recently because they feel slightly differently and I associate that with the possibility of slipping off the pole. So I need to desensitize myself to these differences, and dissociate the strength of my grip and how it feels with whether I slip off the pole or not. It shouldn't matter whatsoever. Next step is to somehow practice disassociating this.
