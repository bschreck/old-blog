Results don't show it

But I know I gave it all this season.

Why else would I get sad when I realize I have to do it all over again?

<!-- more -->

I think about all the shit that needs to happen from now till the time when I can express outwardly what I will have been preparing for and I just want to be at the end state for a while.
It's hard to imagine going through everything again.

This was a good season. Every day I came out with a purpose. Everyday I knew exactly what had to be done, and I did it.

And I did it right. I didn't do it for the outward success like I had previously. I did it for the inner transformation. In the end, that transformation didn't quite present itself outwardly like I would have liked, and like the other athletes around me were able to do. But it readied me for battle. It prepared me for life, and specifically for directing my life. What happens next is determined by me and me alone, with everyone else acting to help me out and let me live.

I won. I won at the only game that matters- the only game where winning means nothing. The only game where winning is never actually possible. I understand now. I can do whatever the flows around me hint is the downstream path. The disguised path of least resistance. This is not about swimming upstream, as most mental advisors, success advocates, and determined coaches will let me know. It's not about fighting "the easy way". It's about discovering another, separate, much less violent or choppy path, through which I can flow silently with ease, content with every second of the ride.
