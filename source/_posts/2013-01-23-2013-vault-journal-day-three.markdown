Took a bunch of 3's on the 14' 155, which seemed slightly bigger than the 150 but still manageable. But I was trying to get my step out and stand up taller, which made things feel weird. Then things still felt weird when I tried to go back to 4. I then went to a small green pole but I had never jumped on it before so it took me a few to take one up. But I got on it and it was pretty small. Then I kept going back and forth between taking some decent jumps from 3 and trying to go from 4 on that pole. I got pretty close at the end when I really got into a rhythm and really pretended like it was just a 3 step, to the point when I would do a really quick pole grab and run the first two steps without thinking, and then count my 3 step out loud.
