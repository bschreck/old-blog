Who fucking gives a shit

Kind of my anthem for the final meet before nationals. I didn't sleep the night before for whatever stupid reason. Ran thru 3 times for a circular ending to a long story. This season turned out the same as senior year of high school except that I'm jumping 8 inches higher and I don't get as mad or sad and I'm a little more confident in myself as a human being. I don't know if I've actually changed and improved since then or if I just build these temporary paths around the permanent mental problem. There's no way to know for sure and I've given my life to this sport so I have to assume i have changed and continue with my last two years and try to keep overcoming it.

The thing is that I'm so mentally exhausted of this shit. I give up so much time and energy to solving this shit. I could do so much more with my life, be so much happier.

Maybe I'm just tired from last night. But I have lots of new great habits to form over the summer and do great things. I'll worry about this shit in the fall.
