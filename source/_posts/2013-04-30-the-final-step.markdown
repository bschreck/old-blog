Today I realized the final step which I hadn't talked about yesterday. To truly find success, you must have a sort of ultimate meta-belief about your beliefs-- that you are in complete control of your beliefs, and thus your destiny. You need to know that you have total mind-control, and whenever a doubt or misbelief enters your head you have the capability to change it or remove it. This belief is really a feeling, one that permeates your whole body and allows you to let go, to be at peace. With this feeling comes absolute freedom. You are in control of the beliefs, which control your habits, which control your life.
