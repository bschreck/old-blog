What I'm thinking about (obviously related to pole vault)

Finding and preserving the right state is critically important. There is a particular state in which I can pole vault. And in this state pole vaulting is easy. In this state I'm happy, loose, light-headed, carefree, laughing a lot, not thinking about what could go wrong, reducing the sport to a game. Having fun. Right now transitioning to and from this state is a volatile process. It's an unstable state. Too hard to get in, too easy to get out. I need to work on:

<!-- more -->

1) Recognizing the state I'm in
2) Learning/practicing how to get into, get out of, and stay inside particular states
3) Making the pole vault state a super stable state- sort of a fallback, or natural state.

Thinking about D3's
Thinking about “no shorts jumping”
Thinking about “getting the snacks”
Thinking about the takeoff feeling
Remember how easily 15’ 175 bent at All New Englands
